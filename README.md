# FileMover

Branches:
The development branch contains assert statements 


To do:
- Move files 
- Improve Visual Aesthetic 
- Make it an executable 
- Update the README file
- Add a term that the program will exclude from files. 
      - Add to JSON
      - Make new text box
      - Make new button
      - Make new label
      I would like to make this less work, so lets work on abstracting the same set up I have for the search term.
- Remove JSON from the Git. It does not need to be saved to Git.
